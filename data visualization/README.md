# ProsperLoan Data Exploration

## Dataset

This financial [dataset](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1547699802003000)includes information about loans, borrowers, lenders, interest rates, and other connected topics. A company called Prosper, also known as Prosper Marketplace Inc., is located in San Francisco, California and specializes in giving borrowers loans with low interest rates. We are looking for a trend in the Prosper data in this dataset. Due to the sheer magnitude of the dataset and the complexity of all the financial datasets, this could be tedious.

There are 113937 items in the dataset, which has 81 variables.

All of the dataset's factors are not anticipated to be explored as part of the project goal! But limit your research to just 24 of them.
